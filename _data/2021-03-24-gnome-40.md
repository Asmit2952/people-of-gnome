GNOME 40 is the latest version of GNOME, and is the result of 6 months’ hard work by the GNOME community. It contains major new features, as well as many smaller improvements and bug fixes. In total, the release incorporates 24571 changes, made by approximately 822 contributors.

This release is dedicated to the team behind the GNOME Asia Summit 2020. GNOME Asia is the major annual GNOME conference in the Asia/Pacific part of the world, and is only possible thanks to the hard work of many volunteers. This year’s event was forced to be held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are very much looking forward to meeting our friends from all around the world again in person in the near future.

## Updated Activities Overview

GNOME 40 includes a new and improved Activities Overview design. This gives the overview a great new look, and provides an improved experience for navigating the system and launching apps.

The new design lays out the different parts of the system in two directions. Workspaces are arranged horizontally, and the overview and app grid are accessed vertically. Each direction has accompanying keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures and mouse actions:

- Keyboard shortcuts use `Super`+`Alt`+`↑`/`↓`/`←`/`→`. (Pressing Super continues to open the overview, and existing keyboard shortcuts will continue to work as before.)

- Touchpad gestures use three-finger swipes up/down/left/right.

- Mouse scroll switches workspaces in the overview, and can be used with the Super in the regular desktop view.

Together these provide a fast, intuitive and coherent way to move around the system. Additionally, the app grid can now be easily customized, with enhanced drag and drop making it possible to arrange app launchers so they suit you.

## Weather, Redesigned

The Weather application has been completely redesigned. It now shows more information, and looks better than ever! The new design features two main views: one for the hourly forecast for the next 48 hours, and one for the daily forecast, for the next 10 days.

It is also more mobile-friendly as it supports resizing to narrower sizes.

## Improved Settings

The Keyboard settings have received a number of improvements for this release:

- The input source settings have been moved from the Region & Language to Keyboard. This makes them easier to find, and groups all the keyboard settings in one place.

- Additional settings have also been added, so that it is now possible to configure the Compose and Alternate Characters (3rd level chooser) keys.

- Finally, the keyboard shortcut settings have had an update. They are now arranged in separate groups to aid navigation, and have an improved search design.

The Settings app has a number of other improvements, too. The Wi-Fi settings now pins known networks to the top of the list, and has an overall better layout. Additionally, the About page now shows the hardware model for your laptop, if it’s available.

## Browse Better

The Web application has a new tabs design, which are easier to use and more powerful than before, allowing tabs to be quickly scrolled and resolving several deficiencies with the prior design.

Web can now also be configured to display search suggestions from Google if desired.
