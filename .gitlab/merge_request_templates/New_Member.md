## Notice ##

- Please check if you filled the `contributtors.json` correctly
- Please only add truthy information. For example, don't add a "Board of Directors" badge if you're currently not a Board Member.
- Verify if everything is working and you added a `title`, `badges`, `projects` and `social` networks that exist. Inside the proper jSON files. If not, you may also add a new one in a different Merge Request.
