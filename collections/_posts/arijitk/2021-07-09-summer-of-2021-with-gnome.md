GNOME Foundation is a vibrant worldwide community of amazing people involved in making GNOME, one of the most loved desktop environment. The community is not limited to the people delivering pieces of code. But also includes people helping with designs, translations, documentation, management, and much more.

## Story of Faces of GNOME

GNOME is built by people, and we value your each & every contribution to help create such world-class free software.

Back in 2020, the Engagement team â€” the frontiers of GNOME came with the new initiative [Faces of GNOME][1] to celebrate all kinds of contributions with a motive of creating a much stronger community driven by passion.

## Project abstract

The ultimate goal of the People/Faces of GNOME is to develop a website using modern site generators & JavaScript to showcase all past, current GNOME contributors stated above. It has the intention to let community members create, maintain profile pages, add custom information and markdown supported blogs by providing them with a personal space hosted in multiple languages.

The project includes introducing bots for automating markdown profiles, managing SEO, setting up localization capabilities, reworking search queries, improving web performance alongside deploying the website using GitLab CI services.

The project aims to have a full code-complete solution, with documentation, guidelines, and all the pages complete and ready to be launched which would allow the Faces/People of GNOME to succeed not only as a project and but also as a program.

Stay tuned for my next series of blogs in which I will be sharing the challenges faced, my experience of GUADEC and much more. :)
