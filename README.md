## Pipeline

The pipeline used by the website is the top-level component of continuous
integration, delivery, and deployment.

The pipeline defined by this repository uses the `Ruby2.5` image. The pipeline
consists of a script that runs before the site is tested/deployed. The
script that runs before the test/deployment of the website basically
installs all the `gem/npm dependencies` and then builds the website
before testing/deploying.

`test` stage is performed on all branches but `master`. `deploy` stage on
the other hand is performed only on `master` branch.
